# Sunfish.js

Implementation of the Chess Engine Sunfish.py in JavaScript (not in 111 lines)
A bit of a trival programming language conversion, however I was able to learn a lot about
the various techniques used by the Sunfish engine and was introduced to JavaScript generator
functions.

Uses Chess.js and Chessboard.js as a user interface because Sunfish.py is played in the console.
I also implemented the functionality to play the Sunfish engine with the black pieces.
